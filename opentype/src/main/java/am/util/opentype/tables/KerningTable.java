/**
 * Kerning
 * The kerning table contains the values that control the inter-character spacing for
 * the glyphs in a font. There is currently no system level support for kerning
 * (other than returning the kern pairs and kern values). OpenTypeâ„¢ fonts containing CFF outlines
 * are not supported by the 'kern' table and must use the GPOS OpenType Layout table.
 * Each subtable varies in format, and can contain information for vertical or horizontal text,
 * and can contain kerning values or minimum values. Kerning values are used to adjust
 * inter-character spacing, and minimum values are used to limit the amount of adjustment
 * that the scaler applies by the combination of kerning and tracking.
 * Because the adjustments are additive, the order of the subtables containing kerning values
 * is not important. However, tables containing minimum values should usually be placed last,
 * so that they can be used to limit the total effect of other subtables.
